# Project Plan for Task-Sync

## Objective
Refactor rubric_set and rubric_shell steps to ensure one rubric_shell per criterion, handling all solution patches internally, and storing aggregated results.

## Steps Completed
- Added LocalPath and Results fields to Step and RubricShellConfig models.
- Refactored process_rubric_set.go to create one rubric_shell step per criterion with Assignments.
- Refactored process_rubric_shell.go to iterate over assignments, run tests, and store results.
- Fixed lint errors related to undefined fields and unused imports.

## Next Steps
- Run build and tests to verify changes.
- Test the rubric logic with sample data to ensure consolidation works.
- Address any remaining issues if found.

## Notes
- If pre_patch.patch is empty, the logic should not be blocked; simply skip applying it.
- Investigated bug where held_out_tests.patch is being applied twice, causing errors about files already existing in the working directory.
- Root cause: patch is applied to a dirty git state in containers.
- Fix: Added `git reset/clean` before applying `held_out_tests.patch`.
- Improvement: Added `git apply -R` to the cleanup sequence to reverse any previously applied patch, making the cleanup more robust.
- When running 'rubric_set' with --force, all child 'rubric_shell' steps (upserted and new) should have `{"rerun":true}` set, and after each run the flag should be set to false regardless of command output.
- 'Rerun' field has been added to RubricShellConfig struct to support rerun logic.
- RubricShellConfig.Rerun is now reset to false after rubric_shell execution.
- Git cleaning operations (reset/clean) now occur before any patch application, not after pre_patch.patch is applied.
- Git cleaning logic in ProcessRubricShellStep has been deduplicated.

## Pathing and Configuration Fixes
- **Issue**: Multiple step processors (`rubric_shell`, `docker_volume_pool`, `docker_extract_volume`) were constructing incorrect file paths for patch files and Docker volumes, using a hardcoded, non-existent base directory (`/home/grimlock/Mercor/containerization/container-ansible-single-thread/`).
- **Fix**: Replaced all incorrect path constructions (`stepExec.LocalPath`) with the correct, hardcoded project root (`/home/grimlock/go/task-sync/`). This ensures that patch files are found, hash checks are performed correctly, and Docker volumes are mounted from the proper source directories. (This is wrong fix that needs to be reverted, the correct approach is using the task.settings.local_path as the base path for files)
- **Status**: All known pathing issues have been resolved. The application now successfully executes steps that were previously failing due to file-not-found errors.

## Task List
- [x] Update logic to skip git apply if pre_patch.patch is empty
- [x] Investigate and fix double application of held_out_tests.patch
  - [x] Add git reset/clean before applying held_out_tests.patch.
  - [x] Add `git apply -R` to cleanup logic to handle cases where repo is left in a patched state.
- [x] Update rubric_set logic: set {"rerun":true} on all child rubric_shell steps (upserted and new) when --force is used, and reset to false after each run
- [x] Refactor 'docker_build' step to use triggers.files
- [x] Refactor 'docker_extract_volume' step to use triggers.files with hash checks
- [x] Improve 'docker_extract_volume' step by adding 'triggers.file' hash checks using logic from 'docker_volume_pool' and refactor into utility function
- [x] Fix incorrect path construction for patch files and Docker volumes across all relevant step processors.
- [x] Verify the `git apply` fix by running the pipeline and observing the 'rubric_shell' step execution.
- [x] Fix Rubric Shell Step Duplication: [DONE] (Completed on 2025-07-24)
- [x] Fix rubric shell output reporting to capture and store output correctly with emoji display
- [x] Fix rerun logic for rubric_shell steps: Enhanced runTestSequence to properly handle rerun=true flag with more aggressive git cleanup
- [x] Migrate rubric_shell results storage: Removed duplicate storage in settings.results and now only use the dedicated steps.results column
- [x] Create cleanup command for legacy data: Added 'cleanup legacy-results' command to remove old results fields from step settings
- [x] Database cleanup completed: Successfully cleaned 17 steps that had legacy results fields in their settings

## Recent Achievements (2025-08-01)

### Rubric Shell Rerun Logic Fix
- **Problem**: The `rerun: true` flag was only bypassing hash-based skip logic but wasn't being passed to `runTestSequence`, causing incomplete forced reruns.
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified `runTestSequence` to accept a `rerun` boolean parameter
  - Added enhanced git cleanup when `rerun=true`: `git stash clear`, removal of `.orig` and `.rej` files
  - Added detailed logging to distinguish normal vs rerun cleanup
  - This ensures truly clean environment for forced reruns

### Results Storage Migration
- **Problem**: Results were redundantly stored in both `steps.settings.rubric_shell.results` and `steps.results` column
- **Solution**:
  - Removed `Results` field from `RubricShellConfig` struct
  - Updated `ProcessRubricShellStep` to store results only in dedicated `steps.results` column
  - Updated task report command to read from `steps.results` exclusively
  - Added temporary cleanup logic to remove legacy results from settings
  - Created comprehensive cleanup command for database-wide cleanup
- **Benefits**: Cleaner separation of config and results, better performance, consistency across step types

### Database Cleanup
- Created `cleanup legacy-results` command that successfully cleaned 17 steps
- All legacy `results` fields have been removed from step settings
- Step processing now runs cleanly without cleanup messages
- Report functionality verified to work correctly with new storage format

## Recent Changes (2025-08-14)

- __model_task_check size threshold__: When generating the model prompt file, if inlining `held_out_tests.patch` would make the output exceed 250 KB, we now replace the exact block `<held_out_test_patch>{held_out_test_patch}</held_out_test_patch>` with the message: `held_out_test_patch is provided as an attached file`. Otherwise, the patch content is inlined as before. Implemented in `internal/process_model_task_check.go`.

### Docker Pool Storage Simplification
- Moved container storage from step-level `steps.settings.docker_pool.containers` to task-level `tasks.settings.containers_map` with fixed keys: `original`, `golden`, `solution1..solution4`.
- Moved run parameters to `tasks.settings.docker_run_parameters`.
- Updated `internal/process_docker_pool.go` to always ensure 6 containers and persist to the new task-level fields; step-level `containers`/`parameters` are no longer written.
- Updated consumers to read from task-level:
  - `internal/process_rubric_set_helpers.go/getTaskContainers()` now reads `tasks.settings.containers_map`.
  - `pkg/models/utilities.go/GetAssignedContainersForStep()` prefers `containers_map` with legacy fallback.
- Added `internal/tasks.go/ResetTaskContainers()` to clear `containers_map` and `docker_run_parameters` for a clean slate.

### Docker Build Platform Handling
- Moved platform selection to task-level setting `tasks.settings.platform` (e.g., `linux/amd64`).
- `docker_build` now reads platform from the task and injects `--platform` automatically when not present.
- Temporary migration logic: on processing a `docker_build` step, any `--platform` flags in `step.settings.docker_build.parameters` are removed and persisted to rely solely on task-level setting.
- Files updated: `pkg/models/tasks.go`, `pkg/models/docker.go`, `internal/process_docker_build.go`, `internal/execute_docker_build.go`, `internal/tasks.go`, `help/help.go`.

## Current Goal
All pathing and patch application issues have been resolved. The pipeline is stable. The next goal is to monitor for any new regressions and continue with feature development.

## Current Refactoring: Path Handling
- Renaming 'LocalPath' to 'BasePath' across the codebase for consistent task and step file operations.
- Continuing to update references in remaining files to complete the 'LocalPath' to 'BasePath' rename.
- Completed renames in process_dynamic_rubric.go and process_rubrics_import.go. Fixing remaining files like process_docker_volume_pool.go.
- Fixed 'LocalPath' references in process_file_exists.go to complete path renaming.
- Fixed 'LocalPath' in process_file_exists_test.go to resolve test file errors.
- Fixed 'LocalPath' in steps_test.go to resolve additional test errors.
- Fixed 'LocalPath' in process_docker_volume_pool_test.go to address test errors.
- Added database migration to create 'base_path' column and copy data from 'local_path' to fix runtime errors.
- Corrected migration file to 0009_add_base_path_column with proper up and down SQL files.
- Fixed 'LocalPath' in process_docker_rubrics.go to resolve undefined field errors.
- Fixed 'LocalPath' in process_dynamic_lab.go to resolve undefined field errors.
